## Decorator pattern
The point of the decorator pattern is to extend (decorate) behaviour of an object, without affecting the behaviour of other objects of the same class.

## Observer pattern
Observer is a way of allowing an object to pay atention into the state of another object, and receive an update whenever its states changes. So, we work with two pillars here: the observer, who’s the one looking and waiting for changes, and the subject, which is the one that’s going to be the center of atentions.
