Repo for learning ts design patterns.

## Decorator pattern
### [**See the code on Stackblitz**](https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-design-pattern-decorator?file=index.ts)
The point of the Decorator pattern is to extend (decorate) behaviour of an object, without affecting the behaviour of other objects of the same class.

## Observer pattern
### [**See the code on Stackblitz**](https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-design-pattern-observer?file=index.ts)
Observer pattern is a way of allowing an object to pay atention into the state of another object, and receive an update whenever its states changes. So, we work with two pillars here: the observer, who’s the one looking and waiting for changes, and the subject, which is the one that’s going to be the center of atentions.

## Facade pattern
### [**See the code on Stackblitz**](https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-design-pattern-facade?file=index.ts)
The Facade pattern is one of the structural software design patterns. This pattern hides the complexity of subsystems away from the implementor (client) and it provides an easy-to-use interface to the client.
